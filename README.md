This is the code used for 'Bias from categorizing continuous exposure variables' by Chrystelle Kiang, Lindsay Collin, Tom Ahern, Rich MacLehose, and Tim Lash. 

This is a simulation of the exposure misclassification and bias that may occur as a result of dichotomizing a continuous exposure variable. Briefly, if you categorize a continous exposure variable that is measured with nondifferential error, the misclassification _could_ still be differential. This seems to depend on the underlying distribution of the exposure variable and association between the exposure and disease.
